# Portfolio Milestone 1

Welcome to **Portfolio Milestone 1**!  
This is my very first creative portfolio—an early milestone in my web development journey.  
It’s meant to showcase my initial projects, skills, and growth as a programmer and student.

> **Note:**  
> This is **not** my main or final portfolio. As I gain more experience and build more projects, I plan to create a more polished version in the future. Stay tuned for updates!
